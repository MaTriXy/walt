# Compute the touchpad drag latency
#
# This script computed the touch drag-latency given an evtest log and a
# Quickstep log that were collected while moving a finger at a fixed speed
# back and forth over the laser beam on the pad.  It generates the numeric
# calculations (in seconds) as well as an image that visualizes the data
# for debugging purposes.  This image is useful if the results are surprising,
# as it will often make it very obvious what the issue was.
#
# Usage:
#   1.) Align the Quickstep laser horizontally across the device.  Make sure
#       that the beam is low across the surface and squarely centered on the
#       receiever.
#   2.) Begin evtest log collection while nothing is touching the device.
#           evtest > evtest_log.txt
#   3.) Move a single finger at a constant speed back and forth over the laser
#       on the pad at least 20 times.  A robot will be able to produce more
#       consistent results than a hand.
#   4.) Save a copy of the Quickstep log by accessing its "laser" sysfs entry
#           find / -name 'laser'
#           cat $the_file_you_found_above > quickstep_log.txt
#   5.) Crunch the numbers by passing both file names to this script
#           python latency_measurement.py evtest_log.txt quickstep_log.txt
